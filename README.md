# GlobalPoi.json  
### Global Points of Interest Reference Dataset

**GlobalPoi.json** is a structured, open-source geospatial reference dataset maintained by **PARKSystems Corporation** under its **Legacy Department**.

The dataset provides a normalized, machine-readable foundation of globally relevant points of interest (POIs), designed to support mapping systems, research platforms, analytics engines, simulations, and intelligence tooling.

---

## Overview

GlobalPoi.json consolidates critical geographic reference data into a single, extensible JSON schema.  
It is intended to serve as a **stable baseline layer** for systems that require consistent global location primitives.

This dataset is not an application, service, or API.  
It is a **foundational reference asset**.

## Included Data Categories

Depending on version, GlobalPoi.json may include:

- Sovereign countries and territories  
- Capital cities and major population centers  
- Ports and maritime infrastructure  
- Airports and aviation hubs  
- Strategic maritime chokepoints  
- Shipping lanes and trade corridors  
- Conflict and risk-adjacent regions  
- Weather and climate basins  
- Regionally significant landmarks and nodes  

Each entry is designed to be:
- Deterministic  
- Explicitly typed  
- Geospatially anchored (latitude / longitude)  
- Easily ingestible into downstream systems

## Design Principles

- **Neutrality** — No political, financial, or strategic bias is encoded  
- **Stability** — Backward compatibility is prioritized  
- **Extensibility** — New categories may be appended without breaking schema  
- **Transparency** — Human-readable and machine-parseable  

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Global mapping and visualization tools  
- Research terminals and dashboards  
- Simulation environments  
- Risk and logistics modeling  
- Event correlation systems  
- Educational and analytical projects  

---

## Governance & Maintenance

GlobalPoi.json is released by **PARKSystems Corporation – Legacy Department** as part of a long-term commitment to preserving foundational datasets that remain useful regardless of platform, trend, or technology cycle.

The Legacy Department focuses on:
- Durable reference data  
- Long-horizon utility  
- Minimal dependency surfaces
